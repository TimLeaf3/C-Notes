##### What is Trigonometry ?

Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics concerned with relationships between angles and side lengths of triangles [(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry).

##### Trigonometric Ratios

Trigonometric ratios are the ratios between edges of a right triangle. These ratios depend only on one acute angle of the right triangle, since any two right triangles with the same acute angle are similar.

- **`Cosine`** is defined as the ratio of the adjacent leg to the hypotenuse

	$\text{cos(A)} = {\text{adjacent} \over \text{hypotenuse}} = {b \over h}$


- **`Sine`** is defined as the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse

	$\text{sin(A)} = {\text{opposite} \over \text{hypotenuse}} = {a \over h}$


- **`Tangent`** is defined as the ratio of the opposite leg to the adjacent leg.

	$\text{tan(A)} = {\text{opposite} \over \text{adjacent}} = {a \over b}$

##### Unit Circle

In maths, a unit circle is a circle of unit radius — that is, a radius of 1 [(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle).

Frequently, the unit circle is the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin `(0, 0)` in the Cartesian Coordinate System [(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system).

If `(x, y)` is a point on the unit circle's circumference, then `|x|` and `|y|` are the lengths of a right triangle whose hypotenuse has length 1. Thus by the Pythagorean theorem [(4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) :

$$x^2 + y^2 = 1$$

We can then deduce from this equation that :

$$y = ±\sqrt{1 - x^2}$$

##### Complex Plane

In the **complex plane** [(5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane), numbers of unit magnitude are called the unit complex numbers. This is the set of complex numbers $z$ such that $\left| {~z~} \right| = 1$. When broken into real and imaginary components $z = x + iy$ , this condition is $\left| {~z~} \right| = z \bar{z} = x^2 + y^2 = 1$.

The complex unit circle can be parametrized by angle measure $\theta$ from the positive real axis using the complex **exponential function** [(6)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function)[(7)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula), $z = e^{i\theta} = cos \theta + i \sin \theta$.
